# This is the github for the Bodies in Balance Therapeutic Pilaties website. 

This github _reposwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwitory_ holds all documents **gathered** from working on the Bodies in Balance website, mostly so I can work from different computers with inconsistencies. The final repository will be edited down to the essentials for simplicity and usability, and will include any additional files needed for building the webpages which will not (for the time being) appear here.
