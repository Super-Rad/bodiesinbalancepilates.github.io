# This is the github for the Bodies in Balance Therapeutic Pilaties website. 

This github repository holds all documents gathered from working on the site, mostly so I can work from different computers with inconsistencies. The final version will be edited down to the essentials for simplicity, and will include any additional files needed for building the webpages which will not (for the time being) appear here.
